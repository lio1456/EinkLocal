Why Contribute?

Contributing to the E-Ink Smart Display project is a rewarding experience that allows you to enhance your skills, collaborate with a global community, and make an impact.
Whether you can spare only a little time or are looking to make a substantial commitment, your efforts are highly valued. Even reviewing a single Pull Request makes you a maintainerâ€”and a hero in our eyes!

How You Can Contribute

We appreciate contributions of all types and have outlined several ways you can get involved:

Review a Pull Request:

Help us improve the quality of our codebase and documentation by reviewing Pull Requests. This is a great way to start contributing without needing to write code. Your feedback not only helps improve the project but also supports fellow contributors in enhancing their contributions.

Fix an Issue:

Browse through our Issues tab on GitHub, and pick one that resonates with your skills or interests. If you're new to the project, look for issues labeled good first issue. These are typically smaller tasks that are perfect for newcomers.

Update the Documentation:

Good documentation is crucial for any project. Help us keep our documentation up-to-date by correcting errors, adding examples, or improving existing content. Clear and effective documentation helps new users and seasoned developers alike to understand and use E-Ink Smart Display more effectively.
