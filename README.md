# Project: E-Ink Smart Display 
The ‘E-Ink Smart Display’ is an open source project that is being developed by students at DHBW Heilbronn as part of the Project Conception module until the end of the 6th semester. The aim is to realise a smart display that can present various information via an e-ink display using interface queries.

# The core functions of the display include
### Weather display: 
Presentation of weather information using icons, numbers and text. 
### Date display: 
Display of the current date in dd.mm.yyyy format. 
### Clock: 
Synchronised time based on the atomic clock for maximum accuracy. 
### Calendar: 
Visualisation of important dates such as birthdays, doctor's appointments and deadlines.

# 

### Installing: 
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

### Deployment: 
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
